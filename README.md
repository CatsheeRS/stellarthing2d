# How to build

First you need the .NET 8 SDK

On Linux you're gonna have to install some libraries

Ubuntu:
```sh
sudo apt install libminiaudio-dev -y
```

Fedora:
```sh
sudo dnf install libminiaudio -y
```

To release:
```sh
# idk how it goes on windows
dotnet publish --os win -c Release --sc
dotnet publish --os linux -c Release --sc
```

It's somewhere in `stellarthing/bin/Release/` then the publish folder

If you're using windows you can try [this tutorial](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+linux)
